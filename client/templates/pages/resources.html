      <p>Having used Century Security for several years on our American College of Cardiology annual meeting and expo (in addition to having worked with them prior to joining ACC), I’ve always appreciated the high level of professionalism and dedication to our account. Century’s event managers always seem to pride themselves on running a tight ship and being responsive to the needs of all the players on our large event management staff – including floor managers, general contractor, and other key vendors. The company’s management really becomes part of our “team” in advance of the meeting and on-site. Century knows what’s needed to ensure a safe and secure meeting for all participants, and I’ve enjoyed working with them.</p>
