# Century Trade Show Website

This website will be the new website for Century Event Staffing (currently at http://centurytradeshow.com/). The site will feature a new responsive design, customized order forms for booking orders, and integrated email through MailGun. The client has chosen not to do credit card payments through the website, but this is is something that I can incorporate on future projects.

The site is temporarily hosted at [centurytradeshow.meteor.com](http://centurytradeshow.meteor.com).
