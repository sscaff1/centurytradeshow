The event is a complex one with a multitude of security concerns. Century Security responded to all of the challenges that such an event creates with calm and professionalism. Anybody with experience in this type of event knows how plans are constantly changing and the importance of being able to deal with unexpected situations. In this regard Century Security were exemplary. I can give them no higher praise than to say that we will certainly be using them again in the future.</div><br/>
